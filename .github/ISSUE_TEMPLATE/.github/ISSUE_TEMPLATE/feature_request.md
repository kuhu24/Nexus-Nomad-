**Feature Description**  
Implement an **In-App Chat feature** that allows travelers to communicate directly with each other once they have connected through the platform. This feature will enable solo travelers to discuss trip plans, share travel tips, and make arrangements with their travel partners in real time.

**Why is this useful?**  
This feature will enhance the overall user experience by facilitating easy communication between travelers before and during their trips. It will improve collaboration, reduce misunderstandings, and allow for smoother travel coordination. This will also increase user engagement, as travelers will have an additional way to connect and share experiences.

- Travelers can **ask questions** about destinations, share travel advice, and discuss logistics.
- Travelers can **coordinate trip details** such as meeting times, locations, and group activities.
- The feature will include **private and group chat options**, making it adaptable for both one-on-one and group travel coordination.

**Additional Context**  
- The chat system could include **message notifications** and **attachments**, so users can share photos, locations, and itineraries.
- Potential integration with **push notifications** for new messages to ensure users stay updated on conversations.
- **Design mockups** and **wireframes** for the in-app chat feature are available [here](https://www.example.com/mockups) (replace with actual link if available).

**Potential Challenges**  
- Privacy concerns may arise, requiring encryption and moderation features to ensure a safe and respectful communication environment.
- Integration with **existing user authentication** and chat functionalities could require additional backend work to ensure secure messaging.
