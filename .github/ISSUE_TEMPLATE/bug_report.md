**Describe the bug**  
The **trip cancellation notification** feature does not trigger when a scheduled trip is canceled by the user. The app fails to send a push notification or show an alert, leaving the user unaware of changes.

**Steps to Reproduce**  
1. Open the **Travel Planner** app.
2. Go to the **My Trips** section.
3. Cancel an existing trip from the itinerary.
4. Notice that no notification is sent or displayed to confirm the cancellation.

**Expected behavior**  
When a trip is canceled, the user should receive a **push notification** or an in-app **alert** to confirm the cancellation and offer alternative options.
